  	<h1>Some General information about the architecture</h1>
    <p>
    	The Spiromat package uses an AppModel and a DocModel. An AppModel
    	represents application level parameters or defaults - for instance
    	the gear size for new figures or documents. A DocModel contains
    	one or more FigureSpecs. As such it represents a Spiromat document 
    	in that it contains the actual data elements.
    </p>
    <p>
    	Note that the DocModel does not contain classes for viewing the
    	elements. The viewers are maintained by a Machine instance.
    	The Machine instance passes the viewers to the SpiromatCanvas which
    	is responsible for drawing everything appropriately.
